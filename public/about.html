<h1>About Me</h1>

  I'm Nada and I'm offically now a coder! I started coding becasue f my brother
  in-law and he really inspired me. I'm new to this but I think I'm getting the
  hang of this. I think it's really cool to code and it's fun to me.

  I love to travel, watch netflix, and go to the gym. When I grow up the plan is
  to be a coder and I hope it comes true. My Brother in-law, Sum3a, is a really
  big idol for this plan becuase he was the one who got me a computer and had me
  start this program and I'm happy he did. Enough about me Enjoy my website.
